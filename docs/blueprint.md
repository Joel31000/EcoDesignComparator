# **App Name**: EcoDesign Comparator

## Core Features:

- Data Input: Input interface to specify project details (materials, distances, energy, prices) for classic and eco-friendly material options.
- Project type selector: Selection menu for project type (work, services or supply)
- Data Retrieval: Fetches necessary data (when not provided) from online scientific or professional sources as a background process.
- Price Adjustment: Interactive sliders to adjust the prices of materials such as steel, concrete, copper, and bituminous mixes.
- Calculation Engine: Calculates and compares the carbon footprint for classic vs. eco-materials, showing the carbon savings. Includes the calculation of global cost with both classic and eco-materials.
- Results Dashboard: Dashboard with interactive charts and synthesis maps for visualizing the full cost calculation in euros, CO2 savings in tons, and investment amortization time.
- AI-Powered Data Suggestion: A tool that suggests alternate data resources, to populate missing parameters required for the simulation.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(120, 60%, 40%) converted to a hex code of #339933, representing environmental friendliness and growth.
- Background color: HSL(120, 20%, 95%) converted to a hex code of #F0FAF0, providing a clean and light backdrop.
- Accent color: HSL(90, 70%, 50%) converted to a hex code of #80BF1A, a vibrant green that complements the primary color and emphasizes eco-friendliness.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif font, providing a modern and neutral aesthetic for readability. 
- Use a consistent set of line icons that represent different materials and processes. Icons should be simple, modern and easily recognizable.
- The layout should be clean and intuitive with a clear visual hierarchy. Use tabs to separate different functionalities and ensure easy navigation.
- Subtle transitions and animations should be used to provide feedback and enhance user engagement. Avoid overly flashy or distracting animations.
